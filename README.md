# Rithwik Rajendran - Data Scientist

Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I'm a Data Scientist, who worked at Wipro Limited for 3 years. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and I'm currently coming towards the end of my Master's in Data Science from the University of Bristol.

I started off my career as a software developer before jumping into Data Science within Wipro. I have specialized working with Python and have experience working with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and techniques. I also have limited experience working with deep learning using PyTorch.

In my spare time, I like to watch football, analyse games and write articles. I also do football analytics as a hobby and enjoy making fun data visualisations using Matplotlib and Tableau.

You can find a good amount of my code and pet-projects here on GitHub. But I also post some of my visualisations on Twitter etc.
